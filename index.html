        <h2>What I Enjoy Writing</h2>

        <p>
            I've always enjoyed imagining different worlds and creating characters.
            Most of my stories include heavy ammounts of world building.
            They also are character-driven and fit in the slice of life genre.

        <h2>My Interests in Video Games</h2>

        <p>
            I like how video games combine visuals and text.
            Players can interact with different worlds and influence the narrative.
            I may create video games in the future.

        <h2>Me and Drawing</h2>

        <p>
            I like coming up with character designs.
            I want to go to an art school one day.
            At art school I want to learn more about character and background design so I can make a comic.
