    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        I am 20 years old and from Portland who likes plants and rain. 
        I like reading, writing, and drawing.
        I also enjoy video games and watching media analysis videos on YouTube.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Enjoy Writing</h2>

    <p>
        I've always enjoyed imagining different worlds and creating characters.
        Most of my stories include heavy ammounts of world building.
        They also are character-driven and fit in the slice of life genre.
    </p>

    <h3>Favorite Book Series</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Natsume's Book of Friends</li>
        <li>The Raven Cycle</li>
        <li>Land of the Lustrous</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Interests in Video Games</h2>

    <p>
        I like how video games combine visuals and text.
        Players can interact with different worlds and influence the narrative.
        I may create video games in the future.
    </p>

        <li>Pokemon</li>

    <h2>Me and Drawing</h2>

    <p>
        I like coming up with character designs.
        I want to go to an art school one day.
        At art school I want to learn more about character and background design so I can make a comic.
